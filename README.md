# ðŸŽ® Hero & Villain | Web Game
This project is a college assignment for the Multiplatform Software Development degree at Fatec. I used Vue.js to develop the web game, and incorporated a bit of AI for character generation through Dall-e, with touch-ups in Photoshop. In this turn-based game, you control the hero's actions with the goal of defeating the villain. Can you succeed?
